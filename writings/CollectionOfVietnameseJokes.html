        <div class="text">
            <p>Yes, this is a reference to <span id="spoiler" class="blurred">"Phồng Tôm" (Shrimp Puff Guy)—a classic Vietnamese meme. It features the image of a guy with a stern face, paired with the caption: "Đứa nào cười tao đấm phát chết luôn" ("Whoever laughs, I'll punch you dead"). The image comes from a mugshot of Phạm Minh Phú, taken around 2010 when he was detained by authorities in Hanoi for alleged theft. His photo was later circulated on Vietnamese online spaces, repurposed in image macros, photoshopped edits, reaction images, and parody videos.</span></p>

            <h1>Collection of Vietnamese Jokes</h1>
            <p>Here you have a set of jokes from Vietnam.</p>
            <p>If you're looking for prime examples of Southeast Asian humor, you've found the right spot. The Vietnamese have a wealth of local humor and have also learned from our traditional ally, Russia, famous for their jokes (or "anecdotes"). Until recently, these jokes were unheard of outside Vietnam. But today, you can find them all in English (don't ask about the translator).</p>
            <p>Be warned: some jokes might sound like we're poking fun at ourselves—because we are! Many originated when Vietnam was still developing and we jokingly considered ourselves the biggest disgrace in Asia—kind of like how some Poles view their own country. So, share these jokes with caution. Unless you're Vietnamese, then have fun!</p>

            <h2 id="ATalkingPig">A Talking Pig</h2>
            <p>The teacher was reading "The Three Little Pigs" to the children, reaching the part where one piglet meets a farmer and asks for some straw: "Sir, can you give me some straw?"</p>
            <p>The teacher paused and asked, "Do you know what the farmer said?"</p>
            <p>Little Tèo raised his hand: "Teacher, he said: 'Oh my God! A talking pig!'"</p>
            <h2 id="ThePriceOfACake">The Price of a Cake</h2>
            <p>"One cake costs 1 dollar. How much for 10 cakes?"</p>
            <p>"Teacher, about 9 dollars."</p>
            <p>"Why 9 dollars? Do the math again."</p>
            <p>"Teacher, because when you buy in bulk... they give a discount."</p>
            <h2 id="KnowingTheExamQuestionsButStillFailing">Knowing the Exam Questions But Still Failing</h2>
            <p>Two boys were talking:</p>
            <p>"My sister knew the exam questions 30 minutes in advance, but she still failed."</p>
            <p>"That's not bad! My sister knew the exam questions two months in advance and still didn't make it."</p>
            <p>"What? What was she taking an exam for?"</p>
            <p>"A beauty pageant."</p>
            <h2 id="TheSecretToKeepingClothesWhite">The Secret to Keeping Clothes White</h2>
            <p>John Connor and Kyle Reese were chatting. Kyle asked,</p>
            <p>"I've noticed your clothes are always clean and fresh. What's your secret?"</p>
            <p>John laughed and replied,</p>
            <p>"It's all thanks to my mom. A few days ago, my friends and I went to the fields to catch crabs and snails, and when I got home, my clothes were covered in mud. My mom saw it and immediately bought a huge bag of detergent. Ever since then, my clothes have always been spotless and fresh."</p>
            <p>Kyle was curious, "Wow! What kind of detergent is that?"</p>
            <p>John shrugged, "Oh, it's not about the detergent. After washing that batch of clothes, my mom told me that if I ever got them dirty like that again, I'd be eating detergent instead of rice!"</p>
            <h2 id="CountingChickens">Counting Chickens</h2>
            <p>"Count and see if we have all the chickens at home."</p>
            <p>"There are only eight, Mom."</p>
            <p>"But we have nine!"</p>
            <p>"Yeah, but one keeps running around, so I couldn't count it."</p>
            <h2 id="ButTheDuckSwamAcross">But the Duck Swam Across!</h2>
            <p>A man stood by a river and asked a nearby boy herding buffaloes,</p>
            <p>"Is this river deep?"</p>
            <p>The boy answered, "No, it's shallow."</p>
            <p>The man waded into the river, but after a few steps, he was completely submerged. He turned back and asked the boy,</p>
            <p>"Why did you say it was shallow?"</p>
            <p>"Well, I saw a duck with short legs cross it just fine!"</p>
            <h2 id="MakingAFortune">Making a Fortune</h2>
            <p><strong>Dracula:</strong> Do you think the peanut brittle I made is good?</p>
            <p><strong>Werewolf:</strong> If you sell it, you'll make a fortune!</p>
            <p><strong>Dracula:</strong> Oh, you flatter me! Hehe...</p>
            <p><strong>Werewolf:</strong> Just put up a sign saying "<em>Teeth Extraction with Peanut Brittle Here</em>", and you'll have tons of customers!</p>
            <h2 id="WheresTheProblem">Where's the Problem?</h2>
            <p>One day, the U.S. built an advanced spaceship and invited representatives from leading aerospace nations to witness its maiden voyage. They also included a Vietnamese guy on the test flight.</p>
            <p>The launch went smoothly, but on the way back, the system reported a major malfunction.</p>
            <p>The American quickly said, "Don't worry, this is my field. Give me two minutes." He entered the engine room. An hour later, he crawled out, exhausted, and said, "F*ck, I have no idea what's broken. We're screwed."</p>
            <p>The Frenchman scoffed, "Idiot! Step aside. I'll fix this in 30 seconds."</p>
            <p>Thirty minutes later, he also came out, defeated. "I give up."</p>
            <p>Just then, an email arrived from Earth for the Vietnamese guy. He said, "Let me take a look."</p>
            <p>The other two laughed. "What does this Viet Cong know about spaceships?"</p>
            <p>The Vietnamese guy silently went inside. Five seconds later, he came back out, and the ship was running perfectly. Everyone on board was shocked and impressed.</p>
            <p>As soon as the ship landed, all the national representatives rushed to investigate how Vietnam had advanced so much in space technology. Intelligence agencies secretly analysed the email.</p>
            <p>When the results were finally revealed, it turned out the Vietnamese guy hadn't fixed anything. He had simply sent a message to his boss, and the reply was:</p>
            <p>"Whatever you 'borrowed', return it immediately!"</p>
            <h2 id="JumpingOffThePlane">Jumping Off the Plane</h2>
            <p>On a plane, there were two Vietnamese, two Japanese, two French, and two Germans.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, the plane hit a storm and severe turbulence.</p>
            <p>The captain announced that, to lighten the load and save the remaining passengers, some people had to sacrifice themselves.</p>
            <p>Without hesitation, the two Frenchmen stood up, shouted, "Long live France!!!" and jumped off.</p>
            <p>After a while, the storm worsened. More sacrifices were needed.</p>
            <p>Without hesitation, the two Japanese stood up, shouted, "Long live the Emperor!!!" and jumped off.</p>
            <p>Later, the crew announced that if two more people jumped, the plane would be safe. Otherwise, it would crash.</p>
            <p>Immediately, the two Vietnamese stood up, shouted, "Vietnam is the champion!!!"—and pushed the two Germans out.</p>
            <h2 id="TheWhosTheDirtiestContest">The "Who's the Dirtiest?" Contest</h2>
            <p>Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia held a contest to see who could endure the dirtiest conditions.</p>
            <p>The challenge: stay inside a pigsty that hadn't been cleaned for a whole year.</p>
            <p>First up was Cambodia's contestant. He lasted one day before running out, unable to take it anymore.</p>
            <p>Next was Laos. He made it through the first day, then the second, but on the third day, the judges had to call an ambulance to rescue him due to suffocation.</p>
            <p>Finally, it was Vietnam's turn. The Vietnamese guy entered the pigsty.</p>
            <p>After just five minutes, all the pigs ran out—on three legs, using one leg to cover their noses.</p>
            <p>At that point, the judges had no choice but to declare Vietnam the winner.</p>
            <h2 id="StrandedOnADesertIsland">Stranded on a Desert Island</h2>
            <p>An American, a Frenchman, and a Vietnamese were on a ship when it sank, leaving them stranded on a deserted island.</p>
            <p>A deity appeared and offered each of them one wish.</p>
            <p>The American said, "I wish to be back in the U.S."—and instantly found himself driving through New York.</p>
            <p>The Frenchman said, "I wish to be back in France."—and suddenly, he was strolling under the Eiffel Tower.</p>
            <p>The Vietnamese guy thought for a moment and said, "I wish those two guys were back here with me."</p>
            <p>And just like that, all three were sitting back on the deserted island, looking miserable.</p>
            <h2 id="MilkingABull">Milking a Bull</h2>
            <p>Every year, the U.S. hosts an international cow-milking competition. This year, three contestants made it to the finals.</p>
            <p>The Australian contestant milked for two hours and filled six large buckets.</p>
            <p>The Dutch contestant milked for the same time and got eight buckets.</p>
            <p>Then the Vietnamese contestant entered the barn and started milking. One hour… two hours… three hours passed.</p>
            <p>The judges waited and waited. Thinking he had lost, they were about to award the Dutch contestant when the Vietnamese guy finally emerged—holding only half a bucket of milk.</p>
            <p>The judges asked, "Why did you produce so little in four hours?"</p>
            <p>The Vietnamese farmer wiped his forehead and sighed, "Damn it, someone gave me a bull instead of a cow! Getting even half a bucket was impressive!"</p>
            <p>And just like that, the Vietnamese contestant won first place.</p>
            <h2 id="ThePaintingContest">The Painting Contest</h2>
            <p>One year, the U.S., Vietnam, and China made it to the finals of an international painting competition.</p>
            <p>Having learned from past trickery (like when Trạng Quỳnh fooled China by drawing a "mud dragon"), the Americans warned their female painter to be wary of the Vietnamese contestant. They decided to copy whatever he did to avoid being tricked.</p>
            <p>When the contest began, the Chinese artist carefully painted a majestic tiger.</p>
            <p>The Vietnamese artist, without hesitation, pulled down his pants, dipped his butt into paint, and sat on the canvas.</p>
            <p>Seeing this, the American artist copied him—pulling down her pants, dipping her butt in paint, and sitting on her canvas.</p>
            <p>When the results were announced, Vietnam won first place for speed and creativity.</p>
            <p>The Americans protested, "Why did Vietnam win when we painted the same thing?"</p>
            <p>The judges replied, "Vietnam painted a tomato—with a stem. The American version didn't have a stem."</p>
            <h2 id="WhyPeopleFearTheVietnamese">Why People Fear the Vietnamese</h2>
            <p>The whole world fears the Americans because <em>Americans say it and do it</em>.</p>
            <p>But Americans fear the Japanese because <em>Japanese do it before they say it</em>.</p>
            <p>And the Japanese fear the Chinese because <em>Chinese do it without saying anything</em>.</p>
            <p>So, who do the Chinese fear?</p>
            <p>The Vietnamese—because <em>Vietnamese say one thing, do another</em>, and no one ever knows what's coming.</p>
            <h2 id="ObstacleSwimmingRace">Obstacle Swimming Race</h2>
            <p>Russia hosted the Olympic Games. Seeing that their "little brother" Vietnam had struggled for years without a gold medal, they introduced a new event: Obstacle Swimming Race.</p>
            <p>The details of the event were kept secret until competition day. Countries signed up blindly, only learning the rules at the starting line.</p>
            <p>On race day, ten nations with strong swimming teams lined up at the starting point—along with Vietnam.</p>
            <p>The pool was massive. The organisers announced the rule: Whoever reaches the finish line first wins gold. However, they added a small note: You must overcome an obstacle.</p>
            <p>Just then, ten Russian military trucks pulled up beside the pool. Their cargo doors opened, revealing... ten giant Amazon crocodiles in each truck. The crocodiles were dumped into the water.</p>
            <p>The starting gun fired. Eleven swimmers stood frozen, swallowing nervously, staring at the thrashing crocodiles.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, the Vietnamese athlete leapt into the water, thrashing his arms and legs wildly toward the finish line. He reached it, scrambled onto the shore, and was instantly surrounded by flashing cameras and thunderous applause. A new Olympic record was set.</p>
            <p>Reporters swarmed him. "What motivated you to be so brave?"</p>
            <p>Ignoring the crowd, the athlete stormed away. The questions continued: "Who are you looking for? Who will you inform first about your victory?"</p>
            <p>He turned back, furious:</p>
            <p>"Motherf*cker, I'm looking for the crazy bastard who pushed me into that crocodile pit! If I hadn't made it, I'd be dead right now! That son of a... scared the sh*t out of me!"</p>
            <h2 id="WhoseSoldiersAreBraver">Whose Soldiers Are Braver?</h2>
            <p>One day, generals from the U.S., China, and Vietnam were drinking together. After a few rounds, they decided to test whose soldiers were the bravest.</p>
            <p>First, the U.S. Marine general turned to his soldier:</p>
            <p>"Get on that ship, sail out to sea, and jump into the water to feed the sharks."</p>
            <p>The Marine snapped to attention: "Sure!" He dove into the shark-infested water. Blood instantly turned the waves red.</p>
            <p>Not to be outdone, the Chinese Artillery general commanded his soldier:</p>
            <p>"Climb into that cannon. I'll light the fuse and fire you into that wall."</p>
            <p>The Chinese soldier, pale as a ghost, hesitated—but obeyed. The cannon roared, and his remains disintegrated into dust.</p>
            <p>Finally, the Vietnamese general turned to his soldier and said:</p>
            <p>"Do whatever you want—just be braver than those two."</p>
            <p>The Vietnamese soldier looked him dead in the eye and said:</p>
            <p>"F*ck that. I'm not doing sh*t!"</p>
            <h2 id="WashingMachineAdvertisementIdea">Washing Machine Advertisement Idea</h2>
            <p>Three freshly graduated marketing students applied for a job at a company. One was French, one was American, and one was Vietnamese. The company's director personally interviewed them:</p>
            <p>"Our company is currently selling washing machines. Each of you should propose a TV commercial for our product. The most creative idea gets the job."</p>
            <p>The Frenchman immediately replied: "Put a dirty shirt in the machine, and a few minutes later, take out a perfectly clean white shirt."</p>
            <p>"Too generic, everyone does that," said the director.</p>
            <p>The American thought for five minutes and said: "Put a patterned shirt in, and a few minutes later, take out a pure white shirt."</p>
            <p>"Creative, but who would dare wash a patterned shirt like that? Not good enough."</p>
            <p>The Vietnamese guy simply smiled: "At first, put a Black man into the washing machine. A few minutes later, a White man steps out."</p>
            <p>The director exclaimed, "You're hired!"</p>
            <h2 id="MedicalAdvancements">Medical Advancements</h2>
            <p>At an international medical conference, each country took turns boasting about its medical achievements. By the end, only three countries—America, Russia, and Vietnam—had yet to present.</p>
            <p>The Russian doctor stood up and announced shocking news: "We have found a cure for AIDS!"</p>
            <p>The whole room erupted in applause.</p>
            <p>The American doctor smirked, stood up, and declared: "We have developed a way to suppress cancer cells and completely eliminate them!"</p>
            <p>The applause was deafening. These were truly groundbreaking medical advancements.</p>
            <p>Then the Vietnamese doctor stood up, adjusted his collar... The entire hall held its breath, expecting another shocking revelation.</p>
            <p>"We can remove tonsils..."</p>
            <p>Before he could finish, murmurs and chuckles spread through the audience. Someone whispered, "Seriously? Even our medical interns can do that."</p>
            <p>The Vietnamese doctor continued: "...through the anus."</p>
            <h2 id="BreastSizeComparison">Breast Size Comparison</h2>
            <p>Three university students from Vietnam, Korea, and Japan were discussing women's bust sizes. The Japanese guy pulled out a grapefruit and said:</p>
            <p>"Women in my country have breasts this big!"</p>
            <p>The other two cheered: "Wow, that's huge!"</p>
            <p>The Korean guy then took out a watermelon and said:</p>
            <p>"Women in my country have breasts this big!"</p>
            <p>The others shouted: "Crazy big!"</p>
            <p>The Vietnamese guy then pulled out a rambutan (a small fruit the size of a lychee).</p>
            <p>"This is the size of Vietnamese women's breasts."</p>
            <p>The other two gasped: "That's tiny! Why are you showing that off?"</p>
            <p>"But... this is just the nipple!"</p>
            <h2 id="MyCountryHasPlentyOfThat">"My Country Has Plenty of That"</h2>
            <p>On an overloaded plane, the pilot announced that passengers had to throw away unnecessary items to lighten the load.</p>
            <p>A rich American tossed a suitcase out. The Japanese guy asked, "What was in that?"</p>
            <p>"Just cash, my country has plenty of it."</p>
            <p>Then the Japanese guy threw out a bag. The American asked, "What was in that?"</p>
            <p>"Diamonds, my country has plenty of those."</p>
            <p>Seeing this, the Vietnamese guy casually kicked both the American and the Japanese out of the plane. The pilot shouted, "Why did you do that?!"</p>
            <p>The Vietnamese guy shrugged, "My country has plenty of those bullsh*tters."</p>
            <h2 id="NoNeedToLookOutTheWindow">No Need to Look Out the Window</h2>
            <p>A train was travelling across the world, passing through various countries. On board was a professor who claimed he could tell which country they were in without looking outside.</p>
            <p>People were sceptical and challenged him to prove it.</p>
            <p>He stuck his hand out the window: "It's really hot! Must be California."</p>
            <p>A little while later, he stuck his hand out again: "Brrr! Freezing cold! We must be in Moscow."</p>
            <p>Two hours later, he reached out again and suddenly pulled his hand back.</p>
            <p>"Damn! My watch is gone. We're definitely in Vietnam!"</p>
            <h2 id="TheOpenCauldronInHell">The Open Cauldron in Hell</h2>
            <p>God decided to visit Hell and took a stroll around. He saw cauldrons of boiling oil, each labelled with different countries' names. All the cauldrons were tightly covered—except for one labelled "Vietnam".</p>
            <p>Curious, God asked the Devil, "Why is this one uncovered?"</p>
            <p>The Devil laughed and said, "For other countries, if we don't cover the cauldron, the sinners will help each other climb out. But for the Vietnamese, as soon as one tries to climb up, the others pull them back down. No need for a lid!"</p>
            <h2 id="PublicUrinationIncident">Public Urination Incident</h2>
            <p>During a diplomatic meeting, Russian officials accused Vietnamese people of being unhygienic and urinating in public. The Vietnamese delegation denied the accusation.</p>
            <p>The Russians proposed a challenge: "Tonight, we'll patrol Hanoi with AK-47s. If we see anyone peeing in public, we'll shoot them on the spot."</p>
            <p>The Vietnamese side agreed.</p>
            <p>The next morning, Vietnam reported 37 casualties. Enraged, they decided to retaliate. Two Vietnamese special forces operatives were sent to Moscow, armed with Colt pistols, to do the same.</p>
            <p>They roamed the streets all night but found only one man urinating in public at 2 AM. Delighted, they emptied their clips into him.</p>
            <p>The next morning, Russian newspapers reported: "Vietnamese Ambassador to Russia assassinated by terrorists while performing his duties."</p>
            <h2 id="VietnameseSwordsmanship">Vietnamese Swordsmanship</h2>
            <p>At an international sword-fighting competition, a French knight stepped onto the stage.</p>
            <p>A fly was released, and with a swift stroke, he split it in two. The audience erupted in applause.</p>
            <p>Next, a Japanese samurai slashed a fly into four pieces mid-air.</p>
            <p>The crowd held their breath in anticipation of Vietnam's champion.</p>
            <p>The Vietnamese swordsman stepped forward. Another fly was released. He swung his sword, but the fly remained unscathed.</p>
            <p>The audience gasped in disappointment. Someone shouted, "What a failure!"</p>
            <p>The Vietnamese swordsman calmly smiled: "Look again! The fly may still be alive... but it will never reproduce again."</p>
            <h2 id="ThePlaneAndTheBomb">The Plane and the Bomb</h2>
            <p>"If you had a plane and a bomb, what would you do?"</p>
            <ul>
                <li>American: Load the bomb onto the plane and drop it on a "rogue" Middle Eastern country.</li>
                <li>Bin Laden: Fill the plane with fuel, hijack it with passengers, and crash it into America.</li>
                <li>Vietnamese: Dismantle the bomb for explosives and metal. Dismantle the plane for aluminium and sell it as scrap. Everything gets turned into money!</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A little boy accidentally overturned a cart full of corn. A neighbour, hearing the noise, said:</p>
            <p>"Hey, Tý, it's okay. Come have lunch with me, and I'll help you get the cart back up afterward."</p>
            <p>"You're really kind, but I'm afraid my dad won't like that."</p>
            <p>"Nonsense, come over."</p>
            <p>Seeing the neighbour's goodwill, Tý agreed:</p>
            <p>"Okay, but I'm sure my dad's going to hate it."</p>
            <p>After a warm meal, Tý thanked the kind neighbour and said:</p>
            <p>"I feel a lot better now. But I just know my dad's going to be furious."</p>
            <p>The neighbour smiled:</p>
            <p>"Silly boy! Where's your dad anyway?"</p>
            <p>"Under the cart, sir."</p>

            <p>After marrying the princess, on his wedding night, Aladdin accidentally rubbed the magic lamp. Immediately, the genie appeared, arms folded, watching the newlyweds. Embarrassed, the princess said: "Get rid of that guy!"</p>
            <p>Aladdin quickly ordered: "Genie, go build me a giant castle."</p>
            <p>The genie disappeared and returned just five minutes later, job done, arms folded again, watching them.</p>
            <p>Annoyed, Aladdin said: "Go level three mountains for me."</p>
            <p>Three minutes later, the genie had finished and was back at the bedside.</p>
            <p>Aladdin was at a loss. The princess whispered: "I've got an idea." She called the genie outside the door.</p>
            <p>From that moment on, the genie didn't return.</p>
            <p>In the morning, Aladdin went outside and saw the genie sitting there crying.</p>
            <p>He asked: "Why are you crying? What did the princess tell you to do?"</p>
            <p>The genie sniffled: "She gave me this string and told me to straighten it out... I've been at it all night, and it's still curly!"</p>
            <h2 id="TheCrimeOfLoyalty">The Crime of Loyalty</h2>
            <p>"Why is your face all swollen?"</p>
            <p>"My friends just beat the crap out of me."</p>
            <p>"What for?"</p>
            <p>"For being loyal."</p>
            <p>"But loyalty's a good thing, isn't it?"</p>
            <p>"Yeah... but I was loyal to <em>their wives</em>!"</p>
            <h2 id="WhosThatPerson">Who's That Person?</h2>
            <p>The teacher asked:</p>
            <p>"When someone keeps talking even when no one's interested anymore, what do we call that person?"</p>
            <p>The whole class replied in unison:</p>
            <p>"A teacher!"</p>
            <h2 id="WheresTheDuckButt">Where's the Duck Butt?</h2>
            <p>At a dinner party, three guests who all loved duck rumps (phao câu) happened to sit at the same table.</p>
            <p>When the host carved the duck, none of them said a word, but their eyes locked onto the duck's rump.</p>
            <p>As soon as the plate was served and the host said "please enjoy," all three sets of chopsticks shot toward the rump like lightning.</p>
            <p>One lucky guest snagged it and popped it into his mouth immediately.</p>
            <p>The other two searched but couldn't find it, so they asked: "Where's the duck butt?"</p>
            <p>The lucky one pointed to his mouth and said: "Right here!"</p>
            <h2 id="WishGranted">Wish Granted</h2>
            <p>Once upon a time, there was an old woman living alone in the forest, with only a cat for company.</p>
            <p>One day, sensing her time was near, she hugged the cat and wished: "I wish I were young and beautiful again."</p>
            <p>Poof! She turned into a stunning young lady.</p>
            <p>Then she wished: "I wish my hut would become a beautiful house!"</p>
            <p>Poof! A gorgeous house appeared.</p>
            <p>"But what's the point of beauty and a nice house in the middle of the woods?" she thought. So she wished again:</p>
            <p>"I wish my cat would turn into a handsome young man..."</p>
            <p>Poof! A striking man appeared before her. Delighted, she dragged him into the house...</p>
            <p>Not two minutes later, she ran out screaming: "If I'd known this, I'd rather die!"</p>
            <p>The handsome man muttered: "Who told you to <em>neuter</em> me back then?"</p>
            <h2 id="CaughtByTheString">Caught by the String</h2>
            <p>A thief was caught stealing a buffalo red-handed. He was shackled and taken to the district office. On the way, someone asked:</p>
            <p>"What crime did you commit to end up like this?"</p>
            <p>He replied pitifully:</p>
            <p>"I just picked up a string. And now I'm in shackles."</p>
            <p>The person was puzzled:</p>
            <p>"You were shackled just for picking up a string?"</p>
            <p>The thief replied:</p>
            <p>"Because the other end of the string was tied to something."</p>
            <p>"What was it?"</p>
            <p>"A buffalo."</p>
            <h2 id="TheBravePeoplesContest">The Brave People's Contest</h2>
            <p>Every year at Christmas, the world holds a contest for the bravest people on the planet. As usual, this year the USA, Japan, and Vietnam made it to the finals.</p>
            <p><strong>First up: The American contestant.</strong></p>
            <p>He slowly walks onto the stage, pulls out a revolver fully loaded with six bullets, removes one bullet, spins the chamber, and calmly puts the gun to his temple and pulls the trigger. <em>Bang!</em> He drops dead on the spot—to thunderous applause from the audience and judges.</p>
            <p><strong>Next: The Japanese contestant.</strong></p>
            <p>More straightforward, he immediately sits down on stage, draws a samurai sword, and in a flash performs seppuku, laying his guts out neatly in front of him. Less than a minute later, he too passes away, amid roaring cheers and clapping.</p>
            <p><strong>Finally: The Vietnamese contestant.</strong></p>
            <p>This is the part everyone has been waiting for since Vietnam is the defending champion. The Vietnamese guy leisurely pushes a wooden box to the centre of the stage, then casually takes out a saw and starts cutting the box.</p>
            <p>Five, ten minutes go by—he keeps sawing. The audience starts booing and whistling in frustration. The judges look uneasy. One of them rushes on stage to whisper something to the contestant. He smiles, then opens up the box—inside is a steel-blue bomb. The crowd falls dead silent. The judges are drenched in sweat as the slow <em>screech-screech</em> of sawing continues. Within half a minute, the head judge grabs a megaphone and urgently announces Vietnam as the winner—amid a few cheers but mostly sighs of relief.</p>
            <h2 id="TheStarvationContest">The Starvation Contest</h2>
            <p>A contest is held called "The Starvation Challenge", with participants from Vietnam, the USA, and Japan. Each person is placed in an empty room with only a small bell they can ring if they give up.</p>
            <p><strong>Day 2:</strong> The American rings the bell. Too hungry.</p>
            <p><strong>Day 4:</strong> The Japanese contestant gives up too.</p>
            <p>But the Vietnamese guy keeps going—Day 6, Day 8... nothing. Organisers worry. Finally, they break the door down—and find the guy lying barely alive in the corner, looking like death itself. When they ask, "What gave you such willpower to endure this hunger?" he wheezes:</p>
            <p>"Dammit... who... broke... my... bell...?"</p>
            <p>And then faints.</p>
            <h2 id="TrainTravelContest">Train Travel Contest</h2>
            <p>In a train travel contest held in Vietnam, three countries enter: USA, Japan, and Vietnam.</p>
            <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Travel from North to South Vietnam, using the fewest tickets, while sitting in first class.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Americans:</strong> "We'll use 2 first-class tickets." Their plan: 3 guys hide in 2 toilets, show 2 tickets when checked.</li>
                <li><strong>Japanese:</strong> "We'll use 1 ticket." Their plan: All 3 squeeze into one toilet.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The Vietnamese team?</strong> "We don't need any tickets."</p>
            <p>When it's time for inspection, they sneak into the toilets, knock on the Japanese stall—take their ticket. Knock on the Americans'—take two more. Then walk right into first class with 3 shiny tickets.</p>
            <p>The Americans and Japanese? Kicked off the train.</p>
            <h2 id="Recycling">Recycling</h2>
            <p>A Vietnamese man is eating breakfast in a cafe. An American sits next to him, loudly chewing gum.</p>
            <p><strong>American:</strong> "You guys eat the crust of bread too?"</p>
            <p><strong>Vietnamese:</strong> "Yeah." (annoyed)</p>
            <p><strong>American:</strong> "Huh. In the U.S., we only eat the inside. The crust? We grind it up to make croissants—to sell to Vietnam."</p>
            <p>Then, smugly: "You eat jam too?"</p>
            <p><strong>Vietnamese:</strong> "Of course."</p>
            <p><strong>American:</strong> "In America, we only eat fruit. The peels and seeds—we recycle to make jam, and sell it to Vietnam."</p>
            <p>At this point, the Vietnamese man is clearly irritated. He asks:</p>
            <p>"Hey, do you guys... you know... do the deed?"</p>
            <p>"Of course!"</p>
            <p>"So what do you do with used condoms?"</p>
            <p>"We toss 'em. Duh."</p>
            <p>The Vietnamese man smiles slyly: "Well, in Vietnam, we collect used condoms, melt them down into chewing gum... then export it to the U.S."</p>
            <h2 id="BulletproofArmour">Bulletproof Armour</h2>
            <p>Three hijackers seize an international flight full of passengers. Among them: an American cowboy, a Chinese swordsman, and one Vietnamese guy.</p>
            <p>Everyone is terrified, handing over valuables. Suddenly—<em>slash!</em> The swordsman draws his blade and slices a hijacker in half. But the two others shoot him dead instantly.</p>
            <p>The cowboy reacts fast—<em>bang bang bang!</em>—with two giant revolvers, but he too is gunned down.</p>
            <p>Then the Vietnamese man slowly walks toward the hijackers. They unload their submachine guns at him. Amazingly, after emptying the magazines, the man is still standing. Freaked out, the hijackers surrender.</p>
            <p>Everyone crowds around, asking how he survived.</p>
            <p>"What's your secret?!"</p>
            <p>He calmly takes off his coat.</p>
            <p>Underneath? Bicycle parts. Pressure cookers. Homemade bulletproof armour, Vietnamese style.</p>
            <h2 id="ShortTermPotatoes">Short-term Potatoes</h2>
            <p>At an international agriculture conference, the French delegate said:</p>
            <p>"We plant potatoes on May 15 and harvest them on August 15."</p>
            <p>The British delegate:</p>
            <p>"We also plant on May 15, but we harvest on July 15—an entire month earlier."</p>
            <p>The American delegate:</p>
            <p>"We plant on May 15 and harvest on June 15—two months earlier."</p>
            <p>The Vietnamese delegate:</p>
            <p>"We plant on May 15 and harvest on May 16."</p>
            <p>Everyone in the hall:</p>
            <p>"What? You harvest after just one day?"</p>
            <p>"Yes, at that point we were craving potatoes so badly, we couldn't wait."</p>
            <h2 id="MarginOfError">Margin of Error</h2>
            <p>At the World Scientific and Technical Summit, global powers were presenting their top achievements to prove their scientific superiority.</p>
            <p>The Japanese representative stood up: "We've just completed an unmanned spacecraft for Mars exploration. It has many capabilities, but most notable is that it can fly very close to the Martian surface."</p>
            <p>Judges objected: "Nonsense! How can it fly close? Mars' surface is extremely rugged!"</p>
            <p>Japanese rep replied: "Of course—we accounted for a margin of error of about 20 cm."</p>
            <p>Next, the American rep: "We've also developed a new type of submarine that can dive deep and travel right along the seabed."</p>
            <p>Judges again objected: "That's impossible! The seabed is very uneven."</p>
            <p>"Yes, like the Japanese, we accounted for a margin of error of 20 cm."</p>
            <p>Then the Vietnamese rep stood up: "If that's the case, we've just invented a method of giving birth through the belly button."</p>
            <p>All the judges, and the Japanese and American reps shouted: "That's impossible!"</p>
            <p>The Vietnamese rep calmly said: "Of course, we also accounted for a 20 cm margin of error."</p>
            <h2 id="WhenWillVietnamWinTheWorldCup">When Will Vietnam Win the World Cup?</h2>
            <p>One day, Beckham, Văn Quyến, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiatisuk_Senamuang">Kiatisuk</a> all had a dream where they went to heaven.</p>
            <p>Beckham asked God: "God, when will England win the World Cup again?"</p>
            <p>God said: "In 10 years."</p>
            <p>Beckham sighed: "Oh no, I'll be old by then."</p>
            <p>Kiatisuk asked: "When will Thailand win the World Cup?"</p>
            <p>God said: "In 100 years."</p>
            <p>Kiatisuk sighed: "I'll be dead by then."</p>
            <p>Văn Quyến asked: "When will Vietnam win the World Cup?"</p>
            <p>God replied: "By that time, I'll be dead!"</p>
            <h2 id="LeapOfFaith">Leap of Faith</h2>
            <p>An Englishman, a Japanese, and a Vietnamese guy died and met on the way to the afterlife.</p>
            <p>The Englishman said: "The bravest thing I ever did was jump off the Eiffel Tower."</p>
            <p>The others asked: "When was that?"</p>
            <p>"Two years ago."</p>
            <p>The Japanese guy said: "I once jumped off the Tokyo Tower—that was my boldest act."</p>
            <p>The others: "When?"</p>
            <p>"One year ago."</p>
            <p>The Vietnamese guy said: "Haha, you call that brave? I just jumped off a Boeing 747!"</p>
            <p>The others, shocked: "When??"</p>
            <p>"Just now..."</p>
            <h2 id="AntiTheftMachine">Anti-Theft Machine</h2>
            <p>After years of research, scientists invented a theft-detection machine. To test it out:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In the US: in 30 minutes, it caught 500 thieves.</li>
                <li>In China: in 10 minutes, it caught 5,000 thieves.</li>
                <li>In Vietnam: after just 3 minutes... the machine was stolen.</li>

            <h2 id="DoYouGuysBelieveThis">Do You Guys Believe This?</h2>
            <p>The President of Vietnam invited the US and Russian Presidents to visit Hanoi by helicopter. The three leaders sat together onboard.</p>
            <p>The American President showed off: "You guys believe if I throw a wad of $100 bills down there, tomorrow all of Hanoi will go crazy?"</p>
            <p>The Russian President replied: "You believe if I throw down my wallet, the entire country of Vietnam will go nuts?"</p>
            <p>The Vietnamese President smirked: "You guys believe if I grab the pilot and throw him out, the whole world will go nuts tomorrow?"</p>
            <h2 id="AdamAndEve">Adam and Eve</h2>
            <p>A Frenchman, an American, and a Vietnamese guy were arguing about which nationality Adam and Eve belonged to.</p>
            <p>The Frenchman said: "They were naked and indecent right in front of God—definitely French."</p>
            <p>The American said: "They valued freedom so much they couldn't resist the forbidden fruit, even though it ruined their happiness—clearly American."</p>
            <p>The Vietnamese guy finally said: "No clothes, no house, not even allowed to eat an apple, yet people call that paradise? They must have been Vietnamese!"</p>
            <h2 id="TheVietnameseParadox">The Vietnamese Paradox</h2>
            <p>According to real-world surveys in Vietnam:</p>

            <p>During an international student competition on history (oral exam), a Vietnamese student was caught having studied only one topic, so he tried to listen in on the exam next door.</p>
            <p>The Soviet examiner asked a Cuban student:</p>
            <p>"You have 3 questions..."</p>
            <p>"Yes, sir!"</p>
            <p>"When did the October Revolution in Russia succeed?"</p>

            <h2 id="AdvancedEducationSystems">Advanced Education Systems</h2>
            <p>After Vietnam's recent success at the International Math Olympiad, the country hosted an education summit with ministers from nations boasting top-tier education systems.</p>
            <p>Debate soon broke out over which country had the best system.</p>
            <p><strong>USA</strong>: "In our country, computer literacy comes first. Even 3-year-old kids can use a PC and browse the internet like pros."</p>
            <p>The audience murmured in admiration.</p>
            <p><strong>China</strong>: "That's nothing. In China, we have prodigies who start college by the age of 9."</p>
            <p>The crowd erupted in applause. Then came the host nation, Vietnam. The Vietnamese Minister stood up confidently:</p>
            <p><strong>Vietnam</strong>: "That's all trivial. In Vietnam, we have <em>many</em> students who can't even read or write—yet still graduate from secondary school."</p>
            <h2 id="DiscoveryUnderground">Discovery Underground</h2>
            <p>Recently, Japanese scientists announced: "We dug 100 meters underground and found a 1,000-year-old copper cable!" This, they claimed, proved that Japan had landline phones 1,000 years ago.</p>
            <p>Years later, American scientists countered: "We dug 200 meters and found a 2,000-year-old fibre-optic cable!" Proof, they said, that America had internet and cable TV two millennia ago.</p>
            <p>The very next day, Vietnamese scientists made headlines: "We dug 500 meters underground and found absolutely nothing!" Conclusion? <strong>Vietnam had wireless technology 5,000 years ago.</strong></p>

            <p>The group checks—only three parachutes remain.</p>
            <p><strong>U.S. President</strong>: "I'm the most important person in the world. I must live!" He grabs one and jumps.</p>
            <p><strong>Elon Musk</strong>: "I'm the richest man on Earth. I need to survive!" He grabs another and jumps.</p>

            <p><strong>Japanese general</strong>: "No need for one minute. As soon as the feather touches the ground, my troops will instantly end it." True to his word, the feather lands—<em>bang</em>—everyone gone.</p>
            <p><strong>Vietnamese general</strong>: He releases a feather too. One minute. Five. Ten. Nothing.</p>
            <p>The other generals laugh. But the Vietnamese general smirks and leads them into the room.</p>
            <p>All the soldiers are lying on the floor—blowing on the feather, making sure it never touches the ground.</p>

            <p>At an international aerospace convention:</p>
            <p><strong>American</strong>: "Give me a lump of steel, and I'll build you a Boeing 767."</p>
            <p><strong>Japanese</strong>: "Give me a microchip, and I'll design the entire onboard communication system for that 767."</p>
            <p><strong>Vietnamese guy</strong>, snapping pictures nearby, chimes in: "Give me a flight attendant—and I'll produce a whole crew <em>and</em> unlimited passengers."</p>

            <p>A foreigner working in Vietnam is asked if he's learned any local phrases.</p>
            <p>He replies: "Yes! There's this one sentence I hear <em>everywhere</em>—I didn't even need to study it: <strong>'Một, hai, ba, dô!'</strong>" (Meaning: <em>One, two, three, cheers!</em>)</p>

            <p>A young couple, long in love, finally spend the night together. In the morning, the guy notices a photo of a strikingly handsome man beside the bed.</p>
            <p>Nervous, he asks: "Who's that? Your husband?"</p>
            <p>"Nope," she giggles.</p>
            <p>"Your ex?"</p>
            <p>"Still no!"</p>
            <p>"Your dad?"</p>
            <p>"Not at all."</p>
            <p>"Then who?!"</p>
            <p>She winks: "That's me. Before I transitioned."</p>

            <p>A husband stumbles home drunk, stands outside calling, "Hey you! Hey you!" He can't remember his wife's name, so she doesn't open the door.</p>
            <p>Desperate, he calls his father-in-law: "Hi Dad, quick question: what's my wife's name again?"</p>
            <p>Father-in-law: "You forgot your wife's name?!"</p>
            <p>"Yeah, I drank too much and she won't let me in."</p>
            <p>"Well, I can't help you. I don't even remember <em>my</em> wife's name. You're outside? Me too!"</p>

            <p>Three men—an American, a Chinese, and a Vietnamese—are on the same plane when suddenly Death appears.</p>
            <p>Death says, "You must all come with me. Your time is up."</p>
            <p>Just then, an angel intervenes: "Please, have mercy. Give them a chance to live."</p>
            <p>Death nods, "Fine. I'll give each of you one chance. Throw <em>anything</em> into the sea. If I can't find it, you live. But if I do... you die."</p>
            <p>The American goes first. He thinks for a moment, then tosses a feather into the ocean. Two minutes later—Death finds it. The American is taken.</p>
            <p>The Chinese throws in a sewing needle. Five minutes pass—Death still finds it. He too is taken.</p>
            <p>The Vietnamese guy, now terrified, panics and throws whatever he's holding into the sea.</p>
            <p>An hour passes.</p>
            <p>Death returns, exhausted, panting: "You... you win... I give up. What on Earth did you throw?! I've been searching forever and found nothing!"</p>
            <p>The Vietnamese man sheepishly replies: "Uh... it was... a dissolvable vitamin C tablet."</p>

            <p>Why? Because the husband's "diet" usually consists of: Two chicken thighs, an oyster, and two milk jugs.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, the wife's meal plan typically includes: One sausage... and two eggs.</p>
