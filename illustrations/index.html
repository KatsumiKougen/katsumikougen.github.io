            <p>I've been into drawing since I was a school kid.</p>
            <p>Now as a college student, my skills are improving more and more.</p>
            <p>You might be wondering why I don't share my work on platforms like <s>Purgatory</s> DeviantArt or Pixiv.</p>
            <p>The thing is, DeviantArt has a questionable reputation, so it's not really my scene. As for other platforms, I'm not a dedicated professional artist and don't want to put myself alongside the experts.</p>
            <p>I simply draw because I enjoy it. I'm competent but don't see myself as an expert. Drawing is just a pastime for me, however you interpret fun in art. I'm no Da Vinci; I'm just a guy who's good at a few things, drawing included. And I don't do it very oftenâ€”I mostly spend time browsing online or tinkering with Python and JS coding when bored. So no commissions, thanks.</p>
